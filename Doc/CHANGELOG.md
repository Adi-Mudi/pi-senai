# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `/orchestra-approve` now automatically advances through the completed stage and immediately starts the next working stage (Implement, Document, or Deliver).
- `/orchestra-status` now shows the next command for every stage.
- Stage commands emit completion remarks that tell the user to run `/orchestra-approve` next.
- Manual `/orchestra-XXX` commands remain available as an alternative to auto-advance.
- Moved artifact directory from `.pi/orchestra/` to `.IDE_Plans/orchestra/` to align with the Senai spec.
- Reorganized run artifacts into stage subfolders:
  - `plan/` with nested `scouts/` and `reviews/`
  - `implement/`
  - `document/`
  - `deliver/`
- Updated all documentation to reflect the new auto-advance behavior and artifact paths.
- Updated unit tests to assert the new directory layout and auto-advance behavior.
